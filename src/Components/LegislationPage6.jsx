                Protection Of Children From Sexual Offences Rules, 2020

                <h4 className="fw-bold">Historical Context</h4>
                <p className="aboutpara">
                  The POCSO Rules were formally notified on 9 th March 2020
                  (notification G.S.R. 165(E)), replacing the earlier 2012
                  Rules. This was done to operationalize the amended Act and to
                  address urgent systemic shortcomings, such as low compensation
                  delivery and the absence of support personnel. The drafting
                  was spurred by Supreme Court directives following reports
                  showing that only 1% of minor survivors received compensation
                  and 96% were deprived of supportive assistance during legal
                  processes, with high-profile child abuse incidents in care
                  institutions (e.g., Muzaffarpur, Deoria) accentuating the
                  urgent need for reform.

                <p className="aboutpara">
                  The Rules are designed to implement the POCSO Act with greater
                  efficacy by detailing procedures for awareness campaigns,
                  reporting of offences (including online child pornography),
                  child-friendly investigation and trial mechanisms, medical and
                  legal aid, relief and rehabilitation, compensation, and
                  institutional monitoring- ensuring sensitive, comprehensive,
                  and timely responses to child sexual offences.
