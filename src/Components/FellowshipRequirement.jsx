                 The NLUD Justice for Children Fellowship, supported by UNICEF, is a
                  flagship program for young graduates committed to research on
                  issues surrounding access to justice for children in need of
                  care and protection, and children in conflict with the law.
                  The Research Fellowship aims at building a body of
                  well-researched and accessible scholarship on issues of child
                  rights within the Indian criminal justice system.
