                  The accused claimed juvenility at the time of committing the
                  offence. He produced his school/matriculation certificate as
                  proof of age. The trial court relied instead on
                  medical/ossification tests to determine age. The court was
                  tasked with determining whether ossification/medical test can
                  override a valid matriculation certificate under the Juvenile
                  Justice Act, 2000 (Section 7A + Rule 12 of JJ Rules, 2007).
                  The Supreme Court held that a matriculation certificate is
                  conclusive evidence of age, unless there are <span className="fst-italic">specific doubts
                  about its authenticity.</span> Only in the absence of matriculation
                  or school certificate can ossification/medical test be used.

                  The Court analysed Section 7A of the Juvenile Justice (Care

                  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules, 2007

                  This case established that documentary evidence prevails over
                  medical tests in determining juvenility. Additionally, the
                  court held that age determination should occur with the best
                  interest of the juvenile in mind.
